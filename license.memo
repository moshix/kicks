versions. Updates may include supplemental license terms and conditions
applying after the update is installed.

5. MODIFICATION OF CODE. KICKS object code may not be modified in any way
except by the application of updates obtained directly from me. You may,
entirely at your own risk, modify objects distributed in source form as long
as copyright notices are retained.

6. REDISTRIBUTION. If you provide KICKS materials to another party, you must
provide it without cost to that party, and must provide them the entire and

documentation, and this license. It is your responsibility to ensure that

this license.

Restricted distributions are not permitted; if you redistribute KICKS your
redistribution must be available to all.

Partial distributions are not permitted; if KICKS objects are made available
to others it may only be as a complete original KICKS distribution package
including all install files, documentation, and this license. Redistribution
of individual KICKS objects is not permitted. Especially note that KICKS
objects are not to be placed in publicly accessible source control
repositories, nor any other online site where individual objects can be
accessed.

New or modified objects may be included in redistributed KICKS packages,
however:

 * all said new or modified objects must be additions to, not replacements of,
   existing objects, and
 * all said new or modified objects must included complete source code, and
 * by including said new or modified objects in a KICKS redistribution, you
   assert that you are the owner of the new objects or modifications, and
   that by including them you are transferring to me all of your rights to
   the new objects or modifications, and
 * future KICKS updates or new distributions may 'break' said new or modified
   objects, and
 * at my sole discretion said new or modified objects may be separately
   included or integrated into future KICKS updates or distributions.

To the extent possible, distributions must run on legacy systems (mvs38j and
vm/370). Especially note that source programs must compile using the
compilers available on those systems, and that compiled programs must not
depend on external libraries such as LE.

7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This license shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Alaska, United States of America, as
if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the
principles of conflict of law. If any portion hereof is found to be void or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this license shall remain in full
force and effect. This license constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the use of KICKS.
