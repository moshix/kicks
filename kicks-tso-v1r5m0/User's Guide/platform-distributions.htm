<h2>Notes on operating system distributions
</h2>
<h3><a name="TK3"></a>TSO - older Tur(n)key MVS distributions</h3>
<p>&quot;Tur(n)key MVS&quot; was originated by Volker Bandke in 2002. It is a ready to use
OS/VS2 MVS 3.8j system built specifically to run under the Hercules System/370,
ESA/390, and z/Architecture Emulator. Originally distributed on a CD, it
included a number of MVS source and cbt volumes still replicated (at least by
reference) in more recent distributions. As a <i><b>KICKS</b></i> platform it is
somewhat lacking: no IND$FILE or XMIT370 to ease loading new programs; no GCC,
no user proclibs, no userid.clist in TSO logon procedure, and most importantly
it is missing the TSO/VTAM improvements that in later distributions allow <i><b>
KICKS</b></i> to detect alternate screen dimensions. Some components of the CD
(especially the source and cbt volumes) are available at
<a target="_blank" href="http://tk3.limewebs.com/_TK3herc_links.html">
http://tk3.limewebs.com/_TK3herc_links.html</a></p>
<p>The immediate challenge to installing <i><b>KICKS</b></i> on this system is
lack of XMIT370. Since <i><b>
KICKS</b></i> is no longer distributed on Hercules '.HET' tape images the only
options are (a) install KICKS on a more modern system, then make your own '.HET'
tape image and use that to install; or (b) install XMIT370. An '.HET' tape image
for XMIT370 is at
<a target="_blank" href="http://cbttape.org/~jmorrison/mvs38j/xv0005-beta02.het">
http://cbttape.org/~jmorrison/mvs38j/xv0005-beta02.het</a></p>
<p>GCCMVS is available on
<a target="_blank" href="http://gccMVS.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a> as an
XMIT file, so you could easily install it to use (in addition to COBOL) to make
<i><b>KICKS</b></i> apps.</p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> will greatly benefit from some of Greg Price's vtam mods
(already present on most of the more 'modern' Tur(n)key distributions). You can
find them at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.prycroft6.com.au/vs2mods/index.html">
http://www.prycroft6.com.au/vs2mods/index.html</a>. I especially recommend
ZP60008 and ZP60009.</p>
<p>Of course user proclibs, user clists, and other major enhancements in later
distributions can also be added, but at some point you might ask yourself why
you are reinventing the wheel. when you could just download and install one of
the newer releases and save yourself a great deal of effort...</p>
<h3><a name="MVS380"></a>TSO - Tur(n)key &quot;MVS380&quot; (2012 version) (also applies to
&quot;TK3UPD&quot;) </h3>
<p>The &quot;MVS380&quot; distribution (and the TK3UPD) are descendents of the &quot;Tur(n)key
MVS&quot; originated by Volker Bandke in 2002. These distributions reflect 10 years
of additional customization and selective additions, some of which (IND$FILE,
XMIT370, user proclibs, user clist librarys, and improved TSO/VTAM functionality) are very useful for
a <i><b>KICKS</b></i> platform. MVS380 also included GCCMVS at a very current
level. It is available at
<a target="_blank" href="http://tk3.limewebs.com/_TK3herc_links.html">
http://tk3.limewebs.com/_TK3herc_links.html</a></p>
<p>I developed and maintain <b><i>KICKS for TSO</i></b> on MVS380.</p>
<p>The difference between the TK3UPD and the MVS380 distributions is primarily
that TK3UPD does not come with GCCMVS installed, nor with the (limited) 31 bit
support necessary to compile gigantic GCC programs, such as the compiler itself.&nbsp;
Note that <i><b>KICKS</b></i> programs are not sufficiently gigantic to require
31 bit support. </p>
<p>Either works well with <i><b>KICKS</b></i>, but of course if you want to use
GCC programs in <i><b>KICKS</b></i> it is easier to use MVS380 where GCCMVS is
already installed.</p>
<h3><a name="tk4-"></a>TSO -
	Tur(n)key &quot;TK4-&quot; (update 5 - or newer) </h3>
<p>The &quot;TK4-&quot; distribution is a another descendent of the &quot;Tur(n)key MVS&quot;
originated by Volker Bandke in 2002. A few more years of refinement beyond
TK3UPD, it also has hercules in the same zip file so it really is a &quot;plug and
play&quot; install. <i>This is the recommended distribution for a <b>KICKS</b>
Tur(n)key install, and as a TSO build platform for the <b>KICKS</b> source code</i>.
It is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/">http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/</a></p>
<p>The major difference between TK4- and preceding distributions is the
inclusion of a security system, RAKF. Since <i><b>KICKS</b></i> is in truth just
another TSO application this is, as in Z/OS, only significant in terms of the
security system defining what you think you want your TSO users to be able to
do. If you don't like what it's doing, that's a RAKF issue, not a <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
issue. </p>
<p>TK4- is the &quot;supported&quot; build environment for using the <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
source code. Even if you do not intend to install or use the source you may want
to review the &quot;<a href="Installation.shtml#source">Installing &amp; Using <i>KICKS</i> source code</a>&quot;
section since you may find some of the&nbsp; build system changes useful in your
own TK4- configuration.</p>
<h3><a name="zos"></a>TSO - Z/OS ADCD</h3>
<p>IBM has a distribution called the ADCD, or Application Developers Controlled
Distribution. However, as used in <i><b>KICKS</b></i> documentation the
reference &quot;ADCD&quot; does not refer to the IBM ADCD distribution specifically, but
rather to systems that &quot;look like&quot; it&nbsp; In such systems (which include other
IBM starter distributions and some new or small customer production systems) the
initial programs, procs, and clists are named as originally delivered and
probably not greatly modified and users are not particularly restricted from
accessing them. By comparison, a more mature or larger production system
probably has many of these initial programs, procs and clists isolated (for
maintenance purposes) and restricted from normal&nbsp; user access, instead
having normal users access copies of them (perhaps strongly modified) from site
specific libraries.</p>
<p>Instructions refer to the &quot;ADCD&quot; distribution in this
generic sense because in at least some cases the instructions can be applied
exactly as given, but more generally because when the instruction can't be
applied exactly it should at least be apparent how it should be modified based
on what would be done on an &quot;ADCD&quot; system.</p>
<p>Z/OS distributions and licenses, including the actual ADCD,&nbsp; are only
available directly from IBM. Contact your IBM representative for more
information.</p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> can be installed and run in Z/OS without issue.</p>
<p>GCCMVS is not usually installed on Z/OS, but it is available on
<a target="_blank" href="http://gccMVS.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a> as an
XMIT file, so you could easily install it to use (in addition to COBOL) to make
<i><b>KICKS</b></i> apps. <i><b>KICKS</b></i> does not presently support 
development using IBM C.</p>
<h3><a name="6pk"></a>CMS - older VM/370 distributions </h3>
<p>The 2011 distribution of the VM/370 &quot;sixpack&quot; is available at
<a href="http://vm370.31bits.net/vm370sixpack-1_2.zip">&nbsp;http://vm370.31bits.net/vm370sixpack-1_2.zip</a>. </p>
<p>Because the original VM/370 did not include it, before <i><b>KICKS</b></i> can
be installed on the 2011 VM/370 &quot;sixpack&quot; distribution some kind of 3270 full
screen support must be installed. There are several available. The first was
GCIC, but it is an assembler oriented system not suitable for <i><b>KICKS</b></i>.
The next was mecaff, which provides full screen support via an external java
process. <i><b>KICKS</b></i> works great with mecaff. Finally there is now an
enhancement to VM/370 that provides native x'58' full screen 3270 support (with a
few limitations).&nbsp; <i><b>KICKS</b></i> also works fine with this x'58'
modification.</p>
<p>Since modern versions of mecaff support the x'58' modification as well has
it's original external java process, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> by default requires
this modern mecaff be installed regardless of whether you intend to use the
mecaff java process or native x'58'. A modern version of mecaff can be
downloaded from the files area of the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Hercules-VM370/info">yahoo VM/370
group</a>. Be sure you install the 'static linked' version of the mecaff tools. 
This is necessary because <i><b>KICKS</b></i> uses the DOS/VSAM components of VM/370, 
whose use will cause the 'dynamically linked' versions of the mecaff tools to 
abend (and require you to re-IPL CMS all the time, very irritating...</p>
<p>A CMS port of GCCMVS is preinstalled on the 2011 VM/370 sixpack, but it's a
fairly old version of GCCMVS and not suitable for use with <i><b>KICKS</b></i>.&nbsp; 
You should obtain or build&nbsp; a more current version. I make GCCCMS VMARC 
(compiler and library) available
		in the files area of the yahoo kicksfortso forum, but you really should
		build your own from file on the source forge repository.</p>
<p>I developed and maintain <b><i>KICKS for CMS</i></b> on the VM/370 sixpack.</p>
<p>A normal install of <i><b>KICKS </b></i>on CMS would put the non-VSAM files 
on the user's A disk, and the vsam files on some unspecified mini disk as 
recorded in the FCT. For an install on VM/370 sixpack system I suggest a few 
minor changes, really only amounting to additional specificity to simplify 
installation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">The CMSUSER account on the VM/370 6-pack has 
	empty 192, 193, 194, and 195 mini-disks. You should modify CMSUSER's PROFILE 
	EXEC to release/detach the 194 mini-disk, and to access the 195 mini-disk as 
	'K'. </li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">All <i><b>KICKS </b></i>permanent non-VSAM 
	files should be installed onto the 195 mini-disk that will be accessed as 
	'K'.</li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">The 194 mini-disk should be DOS formatted. A 
	VSAM master catalog and VSAM space will be allocated on it, and the <i><b>
	KICKS</b></i> sample VSAM files will be defined and loaded into that VSAM 
	space. The 194 mini-disk will otherwise remain unlinked so that not just 
	CMSUSER, but <u>any</u> <i><b>KICKS</b></i> user can access the VSAM files.
	<i><b>KICKS</b></i> or associated programs, run by any user, will access 
	this 194 mini-disk as 'O'.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 5px">The values in the FCT's that ship with <i><b>KICKS</b></i> are pre configured as needed for vsam on the 
VM/370 194 disk as 
	above.</p>
<h3><a name="nicof"></a>CMS -
	VM/370 &quot;sixpack&quot; (nicof-0.6.0-playground - or newer) </h3>
<p>The &quot;nicof-0.6.0-playground&quot; distribution of VM/370 is the latest of
the VM/370 sixpack distributions. <i>This is the recommended distribution for a
<b>KICKS</b> VM/370 install, and as a CMS build platform for the <b>KICKS</b> 
source code</i>. You can get it from the files area of the yahoo VM/370 group
<a target="_blank" href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Hercules-VM370/info">
https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Hercules-VM370/info</a>.</p>
<p>Mecaff is preinstalled on the &quot;nicof-0.6.0-playground&quot;, but see the above 
remarks for older VM/370 distributions regarding GCCMVS and suggested install 
changes.</p>
<p>The &quot;nicof-0.6.0-playground&quot; distribution of VM/370 is the &quot;supported&quot; build environment for using the <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
source code. Even if you do not intend to install or use the source you may want
to review the &quot;<a href="Installation.shtml#source">Installing &amp; Using <i>KICKS</i> source code</a>&quot;
section since you may find some of the&nbsp; build system changes useful in your
own &quot;nicof-0.6.0-playground&quot; configuration.</p>
<h3><a name="zvm"></a>CMS - Z/VM ADCD </h3>
<p>IBM has a distribution called the ADCD, or Application Developers Controlled
Distribution. However, as used in <i><b>KICKS</b></i> documentation the
reference &quot;ADCD&quot; does not refer to the IBM ADCD distribution specifically, but
rather to systems that &quot;look like&quot; it&nbsp; In such systems (which include other
IBM starter distributions and some new or small customer production systems) the
initial programs and execs are named as originally delivered and probably not
greatly modified and users are not particularly restricted from accessing them.
By comparison, a more mature or larger production system probably has many of
these initial programs and execs isolated (for maintenance purposes) and
restricted from normal&nbsp; user access, instead having normal users access
copies of them (perhaps strongly modified) from site specific minidisks.</p>
<p>Instructions refer to the &quot;ADCD&quot; distribution in this
generic sense because in at least some cases the instructions can be applied
exactly as given, but more generally because when the instruction can't be
applied exactly it should at least be apparent how it should be modified based
on what would be done on an &quot;ADCD&quot; system.</p>
<p>Z/VM distributions and licenses, including the actual ADCD,&nbsp; are only
available directly from IBM. Contact your IBM representative for more
information.</p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> can be installed on Z/VM systems, but will be of limited
utility if VSAM is not available. VSAM support was most commonly available by
the addition of IBM's &quot;VSE/VSAM&quot; product (probably 5686-081), discontinued
several years ago. VSAM support may still be available if a customer also
licenses Z/VSE to run under Z/VM, but there isn't much information available as
to how those VSE VSAM components could be made available in CMS.</p>
<p>Assuming VSAM is available, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> can be installed and run in
Z/VM without issue.</p>
<p>GCCMVS is not installed on most Z/VM systems so you should obtain or build&nbsp; 
a copy. I make GCCCMS VMARC (compiler and library) available
		in the files area of the yahoo kicksfortso forum, but you really should
		build your own from file on the source forge repository. <i><b>KICKS</b></i> 
does not presently support development using IBM C.</p>
