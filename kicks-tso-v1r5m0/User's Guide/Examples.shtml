<h1>Examples</h1>
<p><br>
<b>Most of the example programs and maps are preinstalled. The files to use them are
defined and loaded during KICKS install. All the materials necessary to
reinstall them are also included.&nbsp; The DB2INQ1 program installation
materials are also included, but it is not preinstalled as it must be linked and
bound to your own DB2 system.</b></p>
<h2><br>
The Murach examples</h2>
<p>Mike Murach &amp; Associates, Inc. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.murach.com">www.murach.com</a>)
publish a variety of computer programming books including
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.murach.com/books/mccp/index.htm">CICS for the
COBOL
Programmer</a> and the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.murach.com/books/cdrf/index.htm">CICS
Desk Reference</a>, both excellent references for CICS (and <i><b>KICKS</b></i>)
programming by Doug Lowe. Murach makes the sample programs for these books
available for free download at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.murach.com/books/mccp/download.htm">http://www.murach.com/books/mccp/download.htm</a>. The ‘Desk Reference’ set is
actually a subset of the ‘for the COBOL Programmer’ set so there is no need to download
both.</p>
<p>These programs are COBOL II (aka COBOL 85) and compile without issue in
modern LE compilers on Z/OS. </p>
<p>But they required major modifications
to compile using the ANSI COBOL compiler included with MVS38J. COBOL II’s structured
programming constructs (EVALUATE, WHEN, END-IF, etc) were particularly
problematic. What I did was un-nest all the structures where the ending END-XXXX
(END-EVALUATE, END-IF, etc) was not immediately followed by a period. I put
these un-nested structures in separate paragraphs at the end of the program, and
put a PERFORM for the new paragraph where the nested structure had been. That
allowed removal of the END-XXX statement. Generally I left the original
statements in the program as comments. </p>
<p>Of course there were numerous smaller changes necessary; you can review the code
to see them.</p>
<p>Plainly my goal was not to generate highly maintainable, nicely structured
programs! I just wanted to convert them so they could be compiled with the
ANSI COBOL compiler, thus allowing use of Murach's high quality CICS programming books
with <i><b>KICKS</b></i>.</p>
<p>While testing I installed these programs (the originals, unmodified) on a
modern Z/OS CICS system to confirm that the behavior of the modified versions in
<i><b>KICKS</b></i> is just like the behavior of the originals in CICS. I
discovered a few bugs in the originals, for example the programs consistently
called ENDBR (and expected it to succeed) when the preceding STARTBR had failed.
I made simple corrections to these minor errors when I found them.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes I made to get the programs to compile and run I
also made a few changes to make them easier to present.</p>
<p>First, the copybooks for some of the files described much of the data as comp-3,
but the test data Murach provides is not valid mainframe comp-3 data. Since I
needed to fix (in some cases generate new) the test data anyway I decided it
would be easier to change the copybooks to define the data as display, which of
course makes the data much easier to handle in an upload/download environment.</p>
<p>Second, some of programs use programmer generated symbolic maps (aka dsects),
but Murach named the copy members for these symbolic maps the same as the binary
map. This is problematic since the standard map generation procedure (<i><b>KICKS</b></i>
or CICS) will overlay the programmer generated members! To prevent this problem
I renamed their programmer generated maps (usually adding a ‘X’ to the end of
the name) and changed the COPY statements in the programs to match. </p>
<p>The following table summarizes the book location, program name, transaction
id, and current <i><b>KICKS</b></i> status of these examples.</p>

<h3>INQ1, INQ2, INQ3, DIN1</h3>
<p>INQ1 (and DIN1, the DB2 version of INQ1), INQ2, and INQ3 are increasingly capable versions of a customer lookup
screen. In INQ1 you must enter a customer number, which is retrieved and
displayed. In INQ2 that earlier behavior continues, but you can also press PF5
to obtain the first customer number on file, or PF6 to obtain the last, and you
can use PF7/PF8 to scroll forward and back through the customer file. In INQ3
those earlier behaviors continue, and in addition to the customer file
information you are also shown up to 10 invoices for the customer.</p>

<h3>MNT1, MNT2, MNT3</h3>
<p>MNT1, MNT2 and MNT3 are increasingly capable versions of a customer file
maintenance program, providing typical Add, Change, and Delete functionality.
The difference between them is in the edits for the Add and Change screens and
the use of screen highlighting to accent fields in error. In these transactions
you enter a customer number and an action code (1 for Add, 2 for Change, 3 for
Delete).</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>When you press enter you are taken to a second screen showing the record to
be added, changed or deleted (in this case changed).</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>Make your changes and press Enter, or Press PF3 or PF12 to return to the
first screen without updating the record. Press PF3 or PF12 on the first screen
to exit (to the menu program). Press PF3 or PF12 again to get back to <i><b>
KICKS</b></i>.</p>
<h3>MENU</h3>
<p>MENU is the transaction id for the screen you’ve already seen after pressing
PF3 or PF12 on one of the previous screens (INQ1, INQ2, INQ3, MNT1 or MNT2). It
provides a convenient way to access MNT2 and INQ1 (if you think it really should
bring up INQ2 or INQ3 go change the code for INVMENU &amp; recompile!). It also
accesses the Order Entry program we will look at next.</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<h3>ORD1</h3>
<p>ORD1 is the transaction id that brings up the order entry system</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>This isn’t an especially easy system to use. You have to know the customer
numbers (hint: 400001, 400002, … ) and the product numbers (hint: 0000000001,
0000000005, … ) to be able to generate an order. For example:</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>Of course you can get a quick list of the customer numbers using the INQ2 or
INQ3 transactions to browse that file. Unfortunately there isn’t a browse
transactions for the product file, so the easiest way to get a list of all the
product numbers is to examine the product file load in
<font face="Courier New">userid.kicks.v1r5m0.instlib(loadmur)</font>. </p>
<p>When you press ENTER on the above screen you are returned to a blank entry
screen to enter another order. When you press PF12 or PF3 on that screen you
will see</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>And pressing ENTER again takes you back to the MENU screen. </p>
<p>If you press PF4 (to make corrections) instead of ENTER you’ll see</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>Where you can change the info you entered and/or add new items. When done
press ENTER to return to the ENTER/PF4 screen, then ENTER again to post the
order.</p>
<h3>SUM1</h3>
<p>SUM1 is a transaction id to generate a simple single screen summary of all
the invoices on file.</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>Press CLEAR to enter the next transaction.</p>
<h3>DFXX</h3>
<p>DFXX is a transaction you can use to generate a variety of abends (Just to
see what happens I suppose). </p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>For example, press PF6 here and you get a AEIL abend announcing itself on the
line just below the “Or press Enter to …” (ie, the abend message shows up where
the cursor was). Press CLEAR to type the next transactions. </p>
<p>It’s also worth noting how CICS and <i><b>KICKS</b></i> differ in their
response to ASRA (and ASRB, and AICA) abends. </p>
<p>CICS is a multi user application. Even though continued operation after one
of these abends may make it far more difficult to determine why the abend
occurred, it would be even worse to shut down CICS for all its users just
because one application failed for one user. So CICS ‘recovers’ in this
situation and (usually) continues to operate ‘normally’. Unfortunately this
recovery is not always 100% successful and sometimes CICS has to be ‘rolled’
later anyway, but at least it tried… </p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> is a single user application. There is no reason to even
try to continue after one of these abends, so <i><b>KICKS</b></i> just prints
its own formatted dump, then (if you provided a SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND allocation)
a system dump, then ends. </p>
<p>There is another significant difference between CICS and <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
in abend processing - CICS is usually configured to backout file and database
changes following a transaction abend – but <i><b>KICKS</b></i> does not do
this for VSAM files. So if your transaction updated a record, then abended – CICS would undo
the update – But <i><b>KICKS</b></i> would leave the file alone (the update
would remain). </p>
<div align="right">
	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="50%">
		<tr>
			<td><font size="1">How CICS 'backout' is done depends on file type
			and ESDS's are a very special case (since delete isn't supported).</font></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>If you enter PF1 on the above screen you will next see</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>At which point you can restart <i><b>KICKS</b></i> or initiate whatever other debugging (TSO
test?) you want.</p>
<h3>CMNT</h3>
<p>If you try the CMNT transaction you’ll see it looks and works pretty much
that same as MENU, MNT2, INQ2. The differences are internal. The CMNT
transaction is written as an example of a structured approach, with the
‘business’ parts of the transaction in one program and the ‘presentation’ parts
in another. </p>
<h3>(Re)installing the Murach examples:</h3>
<p>Installing the Murach examples from the converted source consists of (a)
reassembling the maps; (b) recompiling the programs; (c) defining and loading
the files; (d) adding the required <i><b>KICKS</b></i> table entries; (e)
updating the <i><b>KICKS</b></i> clist.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 2px">Updating the <i><b>KICKS</b></i> clist </p>

	<p>The <i><b>KICKS</b></i> clist needs to allocate the files needed for the
	application – ie – for each fct entry there should be an alloc in the clist.
	The specific statements are:
<pre>
		ALLOC FI(CUSTMAS) DA('userid.KICKS.MURACH.CUSTMAS') SHR
		ALLOC FI(INVCTL) DA('userid.KICKS.MURACH.INVCTL') SHR
		ALLOC FI(INVOICE) DA('userid.KICKS.MURACH.INVOICE') SHR

		ALLOC FI(PRODUCT) DA('userid.KICKS.MURACH.PRODUCT') SHR
</pre>
	<p>It’s usually good practice for a CLIST to free anything it allocates and
	if you examine the <i><b>KICKS</b></i> clist you will see the files freed
	when the CLIST starts (in case they got left allocated somehow) and when the
	CLIST is cleaning up. Note the SHR disposition. Obviously this is necessary
	if multiple <i><b>KICKS</b></i> users will be accessing these files. It’s
	also what <i><b>KICKS</b></i> uses to determine that it should enqueue
	access to files. When <i><b>KICKS</b></i> sees a DISP=OLD file, which
	obviously can’t be shared, it does not bother with enqueuing access.</p></li>

<h2><a name="TacExample"></a>The TAC example</h2>

<p>The TAC example is a real world system used for some years in a State
Department of Labor . It was used as a data entry tool for a variety of records
which were input to a nightly batch process, the ultimate goal being to
reconcile an unemployment tax clearing account. It implements add and browse
function on a VSAM esds. At the time it was written, IT management did not trust
online update (!) so change and delete functionality, though anticipated, was
not implemented. </p>
<div align="right">
	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="50%">
		<tr>
			<td><font size="1">Despite the screen titles this did not originate
			in Nevada. I’ve changed the name to protect the ….</font></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>The various record types that can be entered are represented in the TACREC
copybook, each redefining the previous. The ADD transactions each enter their
own type of record, at the end (the file is a VSAM ESDS, so of course all added
records are at the end of the file). The BROWSE transactions simply start at the
beginning of the file and read the entire file displaying records matching the
subtype in question. Absence of the CHANGE and DELETE functions meant mistakes
could not be fixed, but fixing was not really necessary because a new record
could be entered and the batch process would only apply the last (last record
for a given employee for example) in any day’s run. A typical crude keypunch
replacement system from the dawn of online processing. </p>
<p>This is a cookie cutter application. Lots of programs and maps, but all very
similar. When you’ve seen one of the ‘add’ programs you’ve seen them all. Same
with the browse programs. And of course the change and delete programs are all
just stubs. The one thing that’s worth seeing is the use of Handle Aid and
Handle Condition API’s, unused in the Murach examples. </p>
<p>While this was once a real production system, I’m not certain where in the
system’s life cycle this code came from. There are indications it may have been
a development snapshot rather than a production backup. In any event, it was
coded in “VS COBOL”, a IBM COBOL dialect preceding COBOL II, and was relatively
easy to convert to MVT ANSI COBOL. It was also fairly simple to convert it to
run in a modern LE COBOL (One program using examine instead of inspect; and use
of the preprocessor -wc option to eliminate its dependence on the VS COBOL
when-compiled reserved word). For use as an example it’s nice that it
displays the map name and program name at the top of each screen, with the
compile/mapgen date on the line below.</p>
<h3>Using the TAC example</h3>
<p>Get a clear screen, type BTC0 , and press ENTER</p>
<div align="right">
	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="50%">
		<tr>
			<td><font size="1">If you look at the PCT you will observe a large
			number of ‘BTC?’ transactions. Only BTC0 is intended for operator
			use. The rest are used internally by the TAC system in RETURN
			TRANSID statements. If you type them yourself you’ll be rewarded
			with a ‘BRAF’ abend when the launched program discovers it didn’t
			get a COMM-AREA..</font></td>

<p>That gives you a menu of different kinds of records to enter. Select one of
those with a PF key and you get to a sub menu with add/review/change/delete. You
can also type ‘PF1’ or ‘PF01’ (of similar) at the ‘====&gt; ’. This functionality
is leftover from the days when PF keys were not standard on 3270 terminals! </p>
<p>To continue the example, press PF1 or PF13 for Automatic Refunds</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>Then (for example) press PF2/PF14 for the review screen</p>

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

<p>If you press Enter you will review existing records until you reach the end
of the file, after which you will be returned to the menu. Or enter an SSN to
start the browse with the first of those found. </p>
<p>You can leave the Reconciliation system by repeatedly pressing PF12 or CLEAR.</p>
<h3>(Re)installing the TAC examples: </h3>
<p>As with the Murach examples, the maps are in <font face="Courier New">userid.kicks.v1r5m0.mapsrc</font>. Same
story for the programs and COBOL copybooks. They’re in <font face="Courier New">
userid.kicks.v1r5m0.cob</font>
and <font face="Courier New">userid.kicks.v1r5m0.cobcopy</font> respectively. Use
<font face="Courier New">userid.kicks.v1r5m0.mapsrc($tacmaps)</font> to generate all the maps, then
<font face="Courier New">userid.kicks.v1r5m0.cob($tacpgms)</font> to compile all
the programs - or <font face="Courier New">userid.kicks.v1r5m0.cb2($tacpgms)</font><font face="Times New Roman">in
a Z/OS environment.</font></p>
<p>Similarly the file delete/define/load is in
<font face="Courier New">userid.kicks.v1r5m0.instlib(loadtac)</font>, just view and submit. </p>
<p>The table entries are in the default fct, pct, and ppt in
<font face="Courier New">userid.kickssys.v1r5m0.instlib</font> – here repeated for the sake of consistency:</p>
