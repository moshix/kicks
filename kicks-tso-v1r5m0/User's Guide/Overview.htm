<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><i><font size="5">KICKS</font></i><font size="4"> is an enhancement
for CMS &amp; TSO that lets you run your CICS applications directly instead of having to
'install' those apps in CICS. You don't even need CICS itself installed
on your machine.</font></p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> provides a high level of source code compatibility with CICS
so you can move an application either way between CICS and <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
simply by recompiling. Whether for ease of testing, fast deployment to small
groups of your users, or simple &quot;guerrilla marketing&quot;, join your colleagues
using <b><i>KICKS</i></b> to speed up their development.</p>
<p>Being TSO/CMS based, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> can't support the many thousands of
users a multi-user system like CICS can. But if <i>
<b>KICKS</b></i> can't support thousands of users, it can certainly support a
few hundred of your users, and if having separate address spaces means it can't run as many users it also means
your users aren't so tied to each other's fates - one crash
does not kill all. This reduced consequence of failure often means your new
application's &quot;Time to Market&quot; can be dramatically shortened.</p>
<p>Like CICS, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> supports file sharing among its users. Hundreds of TSO
or CMS users share
db2 tables or VSAM files
with no more concern about doing so than CICS users - and since <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
VSAM support is also available in batch there's usually no need to &quot;close&quot; <i>
<b>KICKS</b></i> VSAM files just so such batch jobs can access them.</p>
<p>Unlike CICS, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> requires no special systems or security
services and can be
easily installed and used by a single applications programmer with a TSO or CMS account.
</p>
<h2><a name="VRM"></a>Version/Release encoding (VRM) </h2>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> modification levels are encoded in a
Version/Release/Modification format. So for example its TSO distribution datasets
for this release are named as USERID.KICKS.V1R5M0.XXX, signifying version 1, release
5,
modification 0 (aka 1.5.0).</p>
<p>Since <i><b>KICKS</b></i> is highly modular, with separate nucleus management modules and
tables as well as components compiled and linked with user applications, <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
performs extensive version checking to ensure all components are compatible.
Eventually that will allow a newer release of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> to tolerate older
applications and maps, perhaps even older tables or even older
management modules in some cases. But for now the version checking is very
rigid: All components, including user applications and maps, must be at exactly
the same level. This means <u>you will have to recompile all your applications with
each new <i><b>KICKS</b></i> distribution</u>. The symptom of a version mismatch in your
application is a <b>VERS</b> abend (or similar, such as VER1, VER2, etc). </p>

	<font color="#FF0000" size="4">CMS</font></b> support</li>
</ul>
<p>What happened to the releases between 1.1.3 and 1.4.0 ?&nbsp; They never
existed. While in development of 1.1.4 we decided VRM was off track. There was a
reason for 1.1.1 in that substantial features (GCCMVS &amp; LE support) intended for
1.1.0 were being delivered late, but 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 really should have been
1.2.0 and 1.3.0. We fixed it by changing VRM for the new release from 1.1.4 to
1.4.0.</p>
<p>1.1.3</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improved sequential terminal (aka CRLP) with fielded input. The BATCH1
	job in TESTCOB has been substantially updated to show most of the features
	of this improved interface.</li>
	<li>Support for localization with ASSIGN api LANGINUSE and NATLANGINUSE
	options, and SIT parameter to specify NATLANG, which defaults to E, (ENU,
	American English). </li>
	<li>Other fixes / improvements:<ul>
	<li>dynamic logo, colored letters changing every few seconds (can be turned
	off)</li>
	<li>added 'API' section to 'Programming' section of KICKS User's Guide.</li>
	<li>more API test/examples added to TESTCOB and TESTGCC libraries.</li>
	<li>fixes for BMS input - erase EOF, numeric justify default, and improved
	MAPFAIL compatibility.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>1.1.2</p>
<ul>
	<li>Support for ENQ and DEQ api calls.</li>
	<li>Support for GETMAIN and FREEMAIN api calls.</li>
	<li>Integrates a number of fixes from the first few months of user
	experience with GCCMVS support.</li>
	<li>Other fixes / improvements:<ul>
	<li>added NOHANDLE support to all api calls</li>
	<li>added preprocessor markup &lt;PRO&gt; &lt;/PRO&gt;, &lt;NPRO&gt; &lt;/NPRO&gt; so programs can
	be setup to use <b><i>KICKS</i></b> Pro features based on availability. See
	...TESTCOB(LINKTST) for example.</li>
	<li>added preprocessor markup &lt;ZOS&gt; &lt;/ZOS&gt;, &lt;NZOS&gt; &lt;/NZOS&gt; so programs can
	be setup to use LE COBOL features based on availability. See ...TESTCOB(GETFREE)
	for example.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>1.1.1</p>
<ul>
	<li>Support for modern LE COBOL compilers on Z/OS.<ul>
	<li>A proc (KIKCB2CL) is supplied to compile and link using the LE compiler.</li>
	<li>Two new 'CB2' datasets - similar to the corresponding 'COB' datasets.
	These contain the sample and supplied programs in COBOL2 form. The CB2
	'Murach' programs in particular are completely different from the COB
	versions: they are essentially straight out of the book.</li>
	<li>All the sample programs and all the api test programs work as expected.</li>
	<li>Only usable on modern systems obviously. Tested on Z/OS 1.6 (COBOL
	3.3.1)</li>
	<li>The Z/OS install procedure has also been substantially improved.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Command Level GCCMVS support.<ul>
		<li>The TESTJCL dataset introduced in 1.1.0 has been split into TESTCOB
		(COBOL programs) and TESTGCC (GCCMVS programs). In general the names of
		the members are the same in both, and the programs exercise the same
		api's.</li>
		<li>Four new 'GCC' datasets - similar to the
		corresponding 'COB' and 'COBCOPY' datasets.</li>
		<li>The map generator proc KIKMG now generates GCC symbolic maps (by
		default into GCCCOPY as well as COBOL symbolic
		maps. The map generator also supports the FOLD= parameter on KIKMSD,
		with LOWER being the default.</li>
		<li>A GCCMVS proc (KIKGCCPP) is provided to preprocess GCCMVS programs
		(like KIKCOBPP does for COBOL programs). Since GCCMVS does not provide a
		compile listing the proc provides one (with line numbers) so that GCCMVS
		compiler diagnostics can be more easily traced to the offending source.</li>
		<li>GCCMVS programs are handled by KICKS just like COBOL programs, and
		should be so defined in the PPT (ie, as LANG=COBOL).</li>
		<li>GCCMVS programs may LINK or XCTL to other GCCMVS programs or to
		COBOL programs. And visa-versa: COBOL programs may LINK or XCTL to
		GCCMVS programs.</li>
		<li>May need to increase region size for KICKS use: Each &quot;link level&quot; of
		GCCMVS requires about 200k (~64 k for PDPCLIB plus 128k for the stack it
		allocates). So a GCCMVS transaction will need at least 200K, and if it
		links to another GCCMVS program add 200k more, etc. This is transient
		use: KICKS cleans up when the program(s) return and when the transaction
		ends (or abends), so a 1 meg TSO region should be sufficient for most
		use (several link levels + some VSAM).</li>
		<li>Tested in Z/OS,MVS380, TK3UPD, and the base TK3 with GCCMVS and PDPCLIB 7.0, 7,6, and 8.0 (current
		as of 10/31/2010).</li>
		<li><b>NOTE</b> - <i><b>KICKS</b></i> does <u>not</u> include GCCMVS. It
		is a standard component of MVS380, and may be downloaded and installed
		on other operating systems as desired. See
		<a target="_blank" href="http://gccmvs.sourceforge.net">
http://gccmvs.sourceforge.net</a><b><font color="#FF0000">. </font></b></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A new SIT parameter, MAXDELAY (default 180 seconds) added to allow
	overriding the previously hardwired 3 minute maximum delay.</li>
	<li>Changed install (TK3 &amp; Z/OS) so that it is now by default all into one (userid)
	HLQ. Added procedures to semi-automate customization for Z/OS use.</li>
	<li>A few other fixes / improvements:<ul>
		<li>Fixed a variety of issues in new transient data &amp; &quot;spool&quot; api's</li>
		<li>Fixed missing pgm/offset in KEDF on RETURN COMPLETE. Also RETURN
		COMPLETE now displays as LINK COMPLETE.</li>
		<li>Fixed several formatted dump trace table print (and related KEDF hex
		output) anomalies</li>
		<li>Fixed timestamp in map generator output (was gmt instead of
		localtime)</li>
		<li>Added check in map generator to ensure field (MFD) is within map
		(MDI)</li>
		<li>Fxed batch userid capture (when USERID= not coded on job card)</li>
		<li>Fxed KEDF for SEND MAP / RECEIVE MAP dsect scrolling</li>
		<li>Added KEDF display of absolute time when DELAY is for TIME or UNTIL
		(ie, wait until a certain time).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>1.1.0</p>
<ul>
	<li>The User's Guide (what you're reading) has been migrated to the web.</li>
	<li>KEDF, a debugging facility similar to CEDF in real CICS. You use it to
	peek around before and after each of your api calls. You can see the api
	call itself, the variables passed in and out, the EIB, the trace table, the
	comm-area(s), your program and it’s working storage, and various system
	areas (cwa, twa, tctteua). See the “Debugging” topic in the “Programming”
	section. </li>
	<li>Sequential terminal - <i><b>KICKS</b></i> can now run in batch as well as TSO. In batch, 3270 input comes
	from the ‘card reader’, and 3270 output goes to the ‘line printer’ – so this
	feature is also called a CRLP terminal. The CRLP terminal supports limited 3270
	emulation. 3270 output screens are reasonably well rendered, less color and
	highlighting obviously. On the input side provision for 3270 ‘aids’ is
	provided so you can, for example, enter a CLEAR command. Sample jobs are
	included to use <i><b>KICKS</b></i> with normal batch jcl, as well as use of the normal
	KICKS clist with the TMP in a batch environment. See the “Using <i>KICKS</i> in
	Batch” topic in the “Operation” section. </li>
	<li>Many of the 'supplied' transactions (KSGM, KSSF, KSMT, KEDF, etc) now
	use larger screens when available (3270 mod 3, mod 4's). Alternate screen
	size support is not new, but its use by the supplied transactions is. Source
	for these transactions can be examined to see how it's done.</li>
	<li>Printing and job submission is supported with the SPOOLOPEN, SPOOLWRITE,
	and SPOOLCLOSE protocol. </li>
	<li>Extrapartition Transient Data (TD) input and output queues are
	supported, and a new table, the DCT, is provided to define those queues.
	These can be used for general sequential file purposes, for example log
	files. They could also be used (and often are) for printing and job
	submission but the SPOOLOPEN api is much easier to use for those purposes.
	</li>
	<li>Screen handling has been improved in several subtle but important ways.
	First, screens are rendered with 3270 sfe orders instead of with sa orders.
	This means <i><b>KICKS</b></i> maps almost always display exactly like they display in CICS. Second,
	<i><b>KICKS</b></i> now supports the “dataonly” option for SEND MAP, so
	complex applications that partially update and reread screens now look and
	work exactly like they do in CICS. Finally, SEND CONTROL has been
	implemented making porting existing programs between CICS and <i><b>KICKS</b></i> a
	little bit easier.</li>
	<li>WRITE OPERATOR (including REPLY option) has been implemented. </li>
	<li>The COBOL language preprocessor has a SYSLIB facility, providing a COBOL
	‘COPY’ syntax more like modern COBOL compilers and the old ANSI COPY syntax
	is still available as well. </li>
</ul>
<p>1.0.0 </p>
<ul>
	<li>The first real release of <i><b>KICKS</b></i>, implementing enough of the full CICS api that useful applications could be developed and run, and many existing
CICS applications could be ported to <i><b>KICKS</b></i>. </li>
</ul>
<p>0.9.0 </p>
<ul>
	<li>An alpha distribution of <i><b>KICKS</b></i>. It initially lacked an MVS based
BMS map generator; a PC based Perl script had to be used to generate maps and
the resulting output upload to MVS for final processing. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Goals"></a>Goals for the next release / level-set.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The 1.5.1 interim release (mid 2015?) will provide early support for 31 
	bit applications; the goal being to get that into user testing well before 
	its official debut in the 1.6.0 release. 1.5.1 thus is primarily for 'z' 
	users and will also feature a preprocessor for IBM C and <b><i>KICKS</i></b> 
	build using that compiler.</li>
	<li>The 1.6.0 release (2016 timeframe?) will feature 31 bit compatibility, IC
	(interval control), trigger processing, and internals documentation.</li>
	<li>The 1.7.0 release (2018 timeframe?) will feature Journaling &amp; DTB
	(dynamic transaction backout), dynamic table update, and maybe a command
	level interpreter.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="MaintenanceSupport"></a>Maintenance/support plan for this release
</h2>
<p>1.5.0 requires that all user programs and maps be recompiled. </p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> has been tested been tested with Z/OS thru 1.12 and with
the MVS38J&nbsp; &quot;Tur(n)key&quot; system including the base TK3 (the one on the CD) as
well as with TK3UPT, MVS380 and TK4-. It greatly benefits from the VTAM fixes and dynamic proclib support in
the newer TK3 versions, but does not require them. </p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> has been tested with Z/VM thru 6.x and with
the VM/370 &quot;Six Pack&quot; system. Its usability with Z/VM is limited by lack of
VSAM support on most Z/VM systems.</p>
